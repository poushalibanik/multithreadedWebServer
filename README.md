Made this project to gain hands on learning experience on computer networking concepts and multithreading concepts in java.
Insights:
=> Analyzed server performance for singlethreading vs multithreading vs threadpool on jmeter.
=> Tried to load server with around 1M requests to check deviation and performance.
=> Tried to increase thread pool size to check throughput.
=> Thread pool vs Event loop
=> Learnt about Executor Service.
